## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### What I learned

For this exercise, my time was spent well. I started with laying out the elements without styling which gave me some solid ground where everything was in place, then, I scripted all that I needed to script, and only after did I style everything to the design. It made me realize that this the optimal way for me where I'm not losing focus while working on the challenge. It was important that I established my workflow for this, since I don't have to think about what to do next whenever I finish a chunk of the work, I just had to move on to the next step, rather than still getting stuck just wondering which part is more effective or more interesting to work on next. I also learned to refactor functions to a point where I felt everything was organized and less complicated to read.
